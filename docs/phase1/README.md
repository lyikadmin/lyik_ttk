# About Phase 1
This is the first project executed between TTK and LYIK. The following are the goals of this project
### Primary Goal
- Realise digitalisation of the visa application for a country in one of the Schengen states
### Outcome of `Phase 1`
While realising the `primary goal` there are several tangible and intangible outcomes of this all important first project. The following is the list of a few important outcomes
1. Establish seamless integration between the two technology platforms, TTK and LYIK
2. Establish the relationship and technology realisation of some of the `visa checklist items`
	1. This is important as TTK maintains the data and the rules for visa processing in `checklists`
	2. These `checklists` are currently referred by the SME (subject matter experts) in assisting customers / clients
3. Establish and realise the technology solution for the UX (user experience) in applying for Visas for retail customers
4. Define and realise the technology solution for the main stakeholders
	1. `Client` (traveller)
	2. `Maker` - A TTK Employee that assists customers with filling the Visa application
	3. `Checker` - A TTK Employee that validates the Visa application and approves it for filing. This is usually the SME for that country

> [!Important] To TTK
> Is there anything else that needs to be considered

> [!NOTE] For Details
> Each of the item in the `outcome` list will be documented in detail. The documents all put together will make the requirements for the phase


### Timeline for `Phase 1`
The business needs to realise the `primary goal` of Phase 1 before the end of `May 2025`.
A detailed project plan will clearly indicate if the goal along with the outcomes can all be realised by the said time.
