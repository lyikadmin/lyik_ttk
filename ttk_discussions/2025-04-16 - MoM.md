## Agenda Items

1. Get all the data / rules for a checklist for Schengen Visa

## Who gets higher weight ?
The `maker` gets higher weight than the `client` as its the former that determines if the application is good to be submitted.
> NOTE: This has to be confirmed as this will have an impact on who gets to edit/override whose data

## A fixed display portion in the UI
it will be good to have a fixed display portion in the UI across sections and tabs to show the travel details on each page. This is not part of the `Elegant` template that will be used for TTK. The alternative is to have that information on each section as a `display` text.

## Passport details
The `issuing authority` is also needed. But this is currently not part of the OCR as this is a `official STAMP`. This would have to be manually entered

## Proof of address
1. Electricity bill
2. Gas bill
3. Aadhaar card
4. DL
5. Voter ID
6. Ration Card

Auto filling of data can be done based on certain available OVDs such as DL, Aadhaar. 

>TODO: Revisit `Residential Address -> Other Address` post reviewing the application form. This might not be needed for a large number of applications

## Checklist Rules
1. The insurance that gets uploaded has to be validated against the traveller details as per the passport etc
2. Check passport validity once uploaded

4. In the `Travel Itinerary` section the following rules are to be implemented
