## Discussion Items

### Stakeholders
The following are the main human stake holders
1. **Client** = Traveller
2. **Maker** = TTK Employee who fills the form
3. **Checker** = TTK Employee who validates data
`Maker` and `Checker` make up the `4 Eyes` of the system
#### Client
- Can edit, upload data and do any modifications to the form
- Has permissions to `Submit` (aka `Good to file`) the form
#### Maker
- Can see all forms submitted by any `client`
- Can edit, upload data or perform any modifications to the form
- Has permissions to `Submit` (aka `Good to file`)
- There are some corner cases where the client will just send the necessary documents to the maker, and ask the latter to `Submit`
#### Checker
- Can only view and review
- Cannot edit any data
	- Checker will go through the submitted form, make sure the data is correct, and then allow it to go through the next steps of the flow
### Portals
1. TTK Portal
	1. This is the portal where `Client` will visit
	2. This is the single entry point to the entire system comprising TTK and LYIK solutions
2. Form filling Portal used for client
	1. This is the LYIK application
	2. Customer will login to the TTK portal and from there can navigate to the LYIK portal
	3. The `Client` can navigate only after having purchased any of the TTK services (such as Visa)
3. Maker checker portal (for internal team)

### Retail and Corporate
There are lot of similarities between `Retail` and `Corporate` journeys.
The difference will mostly be in the area of generating artifacts such as `Invitation Letter`, `Covering Letter` and the like
The `Corporate` journey will be discussed in detail when the time is right for that

Some discussion points
1. Retail 
	1. Upfront payment
	2. Actors: Ttk, Client

2. Corporate:
	1. Upfront payment is not needed. Settlement between TTK and the Corporate
	2. Actors: Employee, Employer
	3. Domain based login
3. Aspects:
	1. Checklist
	2. Timeline
	3. Application Form
	4. Letters
		1. Invitation Letter
		2. Cover Letter
		3. Templatised for company, country

---

### Domain
Don't use `sub domains` inside. Navigation has to be through `URL path` variables
1. ttkvisas.in = TTK portal
2. ttkvisas.in/visaforms = LYIK Portal (Example path for all lyik endpoints in ui)

---

### Client User Experience on the Portal

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
actor Client
Client->>TTK: Pay for Visa <br>Provide Destination <br>Date of Travel etc
TTK->>LYIK: Exchange Token
LYIK-->>TTK: LYIK Token
TTK->>LYIK: Add Travellers (API)
LYIK-->>TTK: Success
TTK->>LYIK: Display Form Filling Portal
LYIK-->>Client: Portal
```

- The `Client` will not see the background exchange of messages between TTK and LYIK
- Behind the scenes TTK is logging the client into the LYIK portal through exchange of Tokens
- Since the TTK portal knows exactly the number of travellers and some details, the records are initially created in the LYIK portal through API invocation
- After a successful creation of TTK portal will invoke the LYIK portal (not API) to show the form filling portal. Here the token will be passed to LYIK
- The `Client` will always get to see a list of travellers. This is where the form filling journey starts

---

### Checklist
1. B2C `Fn(from_country, to_country, visa_type)`
2. B2B. `Fn(from_country, to_country, visa_type, corporate)`

#### Facts about Checklist
- Checklist is the single most important document in TTK
- It contains information about the `data` that is needed for a particular Visa and also the `rules` for processing the data
	- Currently (as of writing this note) the rules are all in the `minds` of the SMEs
	- This will be gradually documented
#### About additional documents
Although the checklist contains information of all data, there will be cases where the SME decides (based on their prior experience) that certain documents will be needed which are not part of the checklist. To cover for such cases LYIK forms will contain a `group` field which can accept any number of extra documents. Each document can have a `title` and `description` field which the SME (`maker`) can use to indicate the reasoning for asking for extra documents.

### User Experience Discussion

The journey for the client spans both the TTK and LYIK portals, yet it must appear seamless and integrated from the client's perspective.

1. **Client logs into TTK Portal**

2. **Client completes payment and creates a new order**

3. **Post-payment, TTK platform initiates background communication with LYIK**

    - TTK and LYIK perform a secure token exchange (Client is unaware of this).
    
    - TTK uses this token to initialise records in LYIK, using the information
        - Number of travellers
        - From and To countries
        - Mobile number of the primary contact
        - Visa type
            
4. **TTK redirects the client to the LYIK portal**
        
    - Each traveller’s record is already prepared and shown in a list format as link records.
        
5. **LYIK Portal Customisations for TTK**
    
    - Custom header designed to reflect TTK branding.
        
        - Includes logo and a “Go to Dashboard” button.
            
    - No TTK Portal header/footer or links.
        
    - No logout button to maintain session consistency across portals.
        
6. **Handling Co-travellers**
    
    - Documents that are common to multiple travellers (e.g. hotel booking) can be re-uploaded across traveller records for convenience.
        
    - Either the `Client` or the `Maker` can perform the duplication action.

### Addons

Addons are optional services that enhance the travel process, and are offered at the form-filling stage within LYIK.

#### Key Aspects:

1. Addons include:
    
    - Courier
    - Travel/Document pickup
    - Insurance
    - Tickets
    - Hotel account
    - Photo development charges
        
2. These options are presented in a **single, consolidated section** towards the bottom of the portal.
    
3. Addons can be selected across different sections of the form, but the **summary and consolidated view** is unified in one place.
    
4. Once selected, **users cannot deselect addons** from this consolidated section directly.

### Addon and Payments

1. **Addon selection happens within the LYIK portal** as part of the form-filling journey.
    
2. **Payments are handled on a per-traveller basis**:
    
    - This gives clients flexibility in managing group travel scenarios.
        
3. **Integration with Razorpay** as the payment gateway.

### Notes:

1. **Form finalization is planned for the next review meeting**
    
    - All stakeholders should validate field structure and sequence.
        
2. **Traveller context should always be visible on the UI**
    
    - Especially in multi-traveller orders, highlighting the current traveller avoids data entry confusion.
